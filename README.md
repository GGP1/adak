Adak is an e-commerce server developed for educational purposes.

This project has two versions: **monolithic** and **microservices**.

For the microservices version please change to the [microservices](https://github.com/GGP1/adak/tree/microservices) branch.

## Features

- Authentication
    - Password encryption using [bcrypt](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt)
    - Email verification
    - Distinction between users and admins
    - Incremental delay when login from the same ip fails multiple times (for mitigating brute force attacks)
- Rate limiter to protect against API abuse and DDoS attacks (DDoSing is stil possible but it will require a high number of computers faking handshakes in parallel)
- Context cancelling
- API documentation using Swagger
- Requests and services logging
- Graceful shutdown
- Connection encrypted with TLS (self-signed certificate as it wont be used in production)
- Input sanitization and unicode normalization to NFC
- Encrypted cookies using ChaCha20-Poly1305 and hex encoding/decoding
- Non invasive user tracking service
- GZIP responses compression (if accepted by the client)
- Stripe integration
- Email and password changing
- Google OAuth2
