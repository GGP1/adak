Adak is a e-commerce REST-API developed for educational purposes, this is the **microservices** version.

It shares most of the endpoints, API and some features with the monolithic version, to take a look at the documentation please head over the [monolithic docs](https://github.com/GGP1/adak).

## Docker

Execute all services using:

```
docker compose up
```

The container serving the *REST API* is called "adak_api" and will be listening on port **4000**.
